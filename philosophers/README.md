You have to write a program for the mandatory part and another one for the bonus part

(if you decide to do the bonus part). They both have to comply with the following rules:

• Global variables are forbidden!

• Your(s) program(s) should take the following arguments:

number_of_philosophers time_to_die time_to_eat time_to_sleep
[number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]

◦ number_of_philosophers: The number of philosophers and also the number
of forks.

◦ time_to_die (in milliseconds): If a philosopher didn’t start eating time_to_die
milliseconds since the beginning of their last meal or the beginning of the simulation, they die.

◦ time_to_eat (in milliseconds): The time it takes for a philosopher to eat.
During that time, they will need to hold two forks.

◦ time_to_sleep (in milliseconds): The time a philosopher will spend sleeping.

◦ number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat (optional argument): If all
philosophers have eaten at least number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat
times, the simulation stops. If not specified, the simulation stops when a
philosopher dies.

• Each philosopher has a number ranging from 1 to number_of_philosophers.

• Philosopher number 1 sits next to philosopher number number_of_philosophers.

Any other philosopher number N sits between philosopher number N - 1 and philosopher number N + 1.

About the logs of your program:

• Any state change of a philosopher must be formatted as follows:

◦ timestamp_in_ms X has taken a fork

◦ timestamp_in_ms X is eating

◦ timestamp_in_ms X is sleeping

◦ timestamp_in_ms X is thinking

◦ timestamp_in_ms X died

Replace timestamp_in_ms with the current timestamp in milliseconds
and X with the philosopher number.

• A displayed state message should not be mixed up with another message.

• A message announcing a philosopher died should be displayed no more than 10 ms
after the actual death of the philosopher.

• Again, philosophers should avoid dying!
